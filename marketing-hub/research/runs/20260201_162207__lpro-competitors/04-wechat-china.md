# WeChat/China Market - Account Management Systems

## Overview
WeChat (微信/Weixin) is China's "super app" with 1.3 billion monthly active users. Multi-account management faces strict platform policies (one phone number = one account), making centralized management tools essential for businesses operating in the China market.

## WeChat Platform Constraints

### Account Policies
- **Each WeChat account requires a unique phone number**
- Cannot use same phone number for multiple accounts
- Maximum 5 WeChat accounts per person can be authenticated
- WeChat actively detects and blocks virtual phone numbers
- Account switching on same device links accounts together

### Multi-Number Acquisition
- Purchase multiple SIM cards (expensive)
- Virtual phone numbers (increasingly blocked)
- WeCom (Enterprise WeChat) for team access without password sharing

## WhatsApp BAN Prevention Best Practices

### Official Recommendations
1. **Use Official WhatsApp Business API**
   - Official methods (broadcast lists, API) won't get banned
   - Third-party Chrome extensions/grey-market APIs detected and banned

2. **Number Warming**
   - Week 1: 100-200 messages/day
   - Week 2: Gradually increase to 500-1,000/day
   - Build positive reputation before scaling

3. **Multi-Number Strategy**
   - Distribute messages across multiple verified API numbers
   - Prevents overloading single number
   - If one number flagged, others unaffected

4. **Message Timing & Pacing**
   - Distribute messages over hours/days
   - Avoid sending all messages simultaneously
   - Appears more natural to algorithms

5. **Quality Rating Maintenance**
   - Monitor quality rating in WhatsApp Business Manager
   - Respond to customer feedback
   - Maintain high opt-in rates

### Messaging Limits
- Broadcast lists: 256 recipients max
- New API senders: 1,000 unique users/day
- Established senders: Can scale to 100k+/day with good quality rating

### Ban Types
- **Temporary:** 24 hours, lifts automatically
- **Permanent:** Number banned, chat history lost

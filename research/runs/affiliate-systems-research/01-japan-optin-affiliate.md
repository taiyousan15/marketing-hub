## 4. Tracking Methods in Japan

### URL Parameter Tracking
Most common method. Affiliate ID appended to URL:
```
https://example.com/lp/?aid=12345
https://example.com/lp/?ref=affiliate_code
```

### Cookie-Based Tracking
Standard 30-90 day cookie for attribution:
```javascript
// On click, cookie set:
document.cookie = "affiliate_id=12345; max-age=2592000; path=/";
```

### LINE Tracking
Unique challenge due to app-based nature:
1. Use URL with tracking parameters
2. Redirect through tracking server
3. Store in LINE rich menu or message
4. Match via user identification post-registration

### Fingerprinting (Advanced)
Used by sophisticated platforms:
- Browser/device characteristics
- Canvas fingerprint
- WebGL fingerprint
- Resistant to cookie clearing
